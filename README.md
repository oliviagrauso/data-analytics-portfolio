## Customer Retention Prioritization based on RFM Analysis

**Business Context and Objective**

Assuming the retention team can act only on part of the customer base, which customers represent the highest risk and the highest value?  
Since resources are limited, prioritization becomes essential.

**Dataset and tools**
- Online Retail II dataset (Kaggle) - standard retail transactional data
- PostgreSQL (pgAdmin 4) for data transformation and modeling
- QuickDBD for ERD diagram design
- Power BI and DAX for visualization

**Methodology (SQL)**
- Data cleaning and transformation - reviewed each column and identified inconsistencies
- Customer-level aggregation
- RFM scoring using NTILE(5) quintile-based segmentation
- Segment classification
- Revenue concentration analysis

**Key Insights**
- 22% of customers (Champions) generate ~70% of total revenue (Pareto principle confirmed)
- 17% of customers are At Risk, representing 11% of revenue
- The analysis supports data-driven retention actions
  
**Final Consideration**

Even standard transactional data can generate strong strategic insights when analyzed with a structured and logical approach.
